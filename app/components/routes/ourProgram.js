                our sponsors

              The Buffalo House is about supporting the needs of our residents by providing a supportive
              healthy living environment that allows our residents the opportunity to become active
              members in the recovery community as well as the surrounding community in which they
              will reside during their recovery. The Buffalo house provides its residents a sober
              supportive living environment in which they can draw knowledge, strength, and support
              from their peers.

              The Buffalo house philosophy is to support our members until they are able to support
              themselves, thus, allowing each member to share their knowledge, strength, and life
              experience with other newly recovering adults. One of the core philosophies and
              principals of the Buffalo house is democracy, we believe that residents should
              have input in the environment they have chosen to explore, grow, and live in the world of recovery.
